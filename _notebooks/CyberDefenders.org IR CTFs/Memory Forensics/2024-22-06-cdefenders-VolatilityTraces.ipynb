    "## Overview\n",
    "As a digital forensics analyst at CyberResponse Inc., you are faced with a critical incident involving a sophisticated malware infiltration at a multinational corporation. The malware has covertly compromised critical systems and initiated unauthorized activities, posing a severe threat to the organization’s sensitive data and operational integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of a captured memory dump to trace the malware's hidden activities. The goal is to meticulously decode the sequence of events, identify the malware's functionalities, and understand its mechanisms of action. This analysis is pivotal in uncovering how the malware evaded detection and executed its malicious payload.\n",

According to this [source](https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility/issues/734) the data structure used to track the process names in the kernel only has room for the first 16 characters of the process name.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Q5:** Recognizing detection-evasive executables is crucial for monitoring their harmful and malicious system activities. Which two applications were excluded by the malware from the previously altered application's settings?   \n",
