    "## Overview\n",
    "A large multinational corporation heavily relies on the 3CX software for phone communication, making it a critical component of their business operations. After a recent update to the 3CX Desktop App, antivirus alerts flag sporadic instances of the software being wiped from some workstations while others remain unaffected. Dismissing this as a false positive, the IT team overlooks the alerts, only to notice degraded performance and strange network traffic to unknown servers. Employees report issues with the 3CX app, and the IT security team identifies unusual communication patterns linked to recent software updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the threat intelligence analyst, it's your responsibility to examine this possible supply chain attack. Your objectives are to uncover how the attackers compromised the 3CX app, identify the potential threat actor involved, and assess the overall extent of the incident. \n",

    "**Q3:** Executable files (.exe) are frequently used as primary or secondary malware payloads, while dynamic link libraries (.dll) often load malicious code or enhance malware functionality. Analyzing files deposited by the Microsoft Software Installer (.msi) is crucial for identifying malicious files and investigating their full potential.

    "**A:**  'RC4'  \n",
    "![](../../images/encryption-type.png)\n",
    "> RC4 is a fast, symmetric key stream cipher used for encrypting data. It uses the same key for both encryption and decryption, making it efficient for real-time applications. Despite its speed, RC4 has known vulnerabilities and is considered less secure than modern encryption methods, so it's not recommended for sensitive data.\n",
