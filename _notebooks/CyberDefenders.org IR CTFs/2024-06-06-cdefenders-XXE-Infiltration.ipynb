    "## Overview\n",
    "You are a cybersecurity analyst at PageTurner, a famous online bookstore. An automated alert has detected unusual XML data being processed by the server, indicating a potential XXE (XML External Entity) Injection attack. This raises concerns about the integrity of PageTurner's customer data and internal systems, prompting an immediate investigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the lead analyst in this case, you must analyze the network traffic to uncover the nature of the suspicious activity. Your objectives include identifying the attack vector, assessing the scope of any potential data breach, and determining if the attacker gained further access to PageTurner's internal systems.\n",
